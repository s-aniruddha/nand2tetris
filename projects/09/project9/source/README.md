This game is inspired by the Google Chrome T-Rex Runner game, where a T-Rex tries to escape from obstacles that keep appearing. Here we have a "runner" who tries to escape collision with an obstacle (currently only one obstacle ;)).

This is a prototype version submitted as weekly assignment. It uses a 32x32 sprite for main character (created by 4 16x16 sprites).
Please use no animation mode in VM emulator.

While there is game room for improvement in terms of the no of obstacles and
graphics of the game interface, the basic features of the game are captured in Jack code.

How to play:

Use the up arrow to make the character jump. The aim of the game is to avoid
as many obstacles (Rectangle) possible. The position of the jumper is reset every time 
the obstacles reaches the left end of the screen. If the obstacle hits the character,
the program will end and main function will return.
